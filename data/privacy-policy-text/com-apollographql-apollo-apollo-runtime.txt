How do we protect your personal information?
We implement common industry-standard security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All user data is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted for storage only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (e.g., credit cards, social security numbers, financials) will not be stored on our servers.
Do we use cookies or other tracking mechanisms?
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
Some of our website’s pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, which are also called single- pixel gifs. These images allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We also may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not used to access your personal information but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics.
We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, to advertise to you on other sites (including but not limited to services such as Google AdWords and Facebook), and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you choose to disable cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. A banner asking you to accept our cookies policy will be displayed upon the first visit to our website (or the first visit after you delete your cookies). Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies and/or you have not accepted our cookies policy, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.
You may also disable Web beacons by disabling HTML images in your email program, which may also affect other images in emails you receive.
We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us analyze visitor activity on our websites. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for Apollo.
These services include (but are not limited to) Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”).
