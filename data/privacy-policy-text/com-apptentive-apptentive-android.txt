The information you provide will be shown on your store listing to help users better understand your app’s privacy, security, and data handling practices before they download it.
Overview
Google Play will soon require additional details in the Data Safety section on the Google Play store. Developers will be required to tell Google about their apps’ privacy and security practices by completing a form in Play Console. Starting in late April 2022, this information will be shown on your app’s store listing to help Google Play users understand how your app collects and shares user data before they download your app. The Data Safety section on Google Play is a simple way for you to help people understand what user data your app collects or shares, as well as showcase your app’s key privacy and security practices. This information helps users make more informed choices when deciding which apps to install.
This document will help you know how to answer the Google Play Data safety questionnaire for the Apptentive SDK.

We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the app developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google Play’s Data safety section form regarding your app’s end-user data collection, sharing, and security practices.
Important: To help you ensure that your app’s disclosures are accurate, we recommend the following:• Always use the latest SDK versions in your app. This page lists the data collected by only the latest version of each SDK.• Review this page whenever you update your app’s SDK versions. Check that your data disclosures are accurate and up-to-date.
Default Apptentive SDK Guidelines OnlyThese guidelines are only for the most basic usage of the Apptentive SDK.They do not cover how an individual app uses their data or every way the SDK can be utilized.These are the data types you should be considering.• Disclose how your app is using those data types in the questionnaire.• Consider if your app is collecting any of those data types in your Apptentive engage events and disclose them in the questionnaire.• Consider if your app is collecting any of those data types in any custom data collection for Person and/or Device and disclose them in the questionnaire.• Consider if your app is collecting any of those data types for any additional reasons not listed below.
