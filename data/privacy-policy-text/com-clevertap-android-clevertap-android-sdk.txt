Developers will now have a transparent way to show users if and how they collect, share, and protect user data before installing an app.
Google has introduced a new Data safety section in the Play Console. Any data shared with a third party must be declared on theGoogle Play Console using the newly-introduced data safety section.
This data will be displayed on the Google Play Store by late April 2022 and help the users make a more informed choice before installing an application.
For more information about the new declaration required in the Data safety section of the Play Console, refer to Google Play's Data safety help.

Data Safety
A user data type is any sensitive or personal information that can identify a user. Google will require app owners to display information about all the user data types collected in the app. You can pass the data types to CleverTap as either User Profile properties or Events.
After you log in to Google Play Console, go to App Content > Data Safety and answer questions about your data sharing. These questions are categorized into three sub-sections as follows:
Data Collection and Security
This section contains questions about data collection, security, and handling practices.
📘Third-party Data ShareCleverTap does not share data with any third parties.
Data Types
Through this section, the app owner can declare all the data types collected by the app.
📘Data Shared with CleverTapCleverTap does not collect any of the data types by default. However, you can configure your app to share data types with CleverTap.
The following table will help you with privacy declaration for data types:
Data Usage and Handling
Data types collected by an application may or may not be shared. Any data transmitted to CleverTap or any other third party by the app will be considered shared data. For example, if a user adds a phone number to the app and records this information, this is collected data. However, if the app shares the phone number with CleverTap or any other third party, then the phone number is considered collected and shared data.
For every selected data type, declare if it is collected, shared, or both.
If your app collects data, declare the following:
Purpose of collecting the data type- Select the appropriate reasons for collecting this data, such as App functionality, Analytics, Developer Communications, and so on.
Is the collected data type ephemeral - Is the data processed temporarily, or if it resides in the app permanently?
User Permission - If the user can allow or disallow data collection.
Data Collection
If your app shares data with a third party, declare the purpose of sharing this data. Select the appropriate reasons for sharing this data.
Data Shared
If your app collects data and also shares data with a third party, declare the purpose of collecting and sharing this data.
Data Collected and Shared
After completion
Until July 20, 2022, you can temporarily publish app updates regardless of whether Google finds issues with the information you have disclosed. If there are no issues, your app will be approved, and you need not do anything. If there are issues, revert your Data safety form's status to Draft in Play Console to publish your app update. Google will also send the developer account owner an email and an inbox message in Play Console and show this information on the Policy status (Policy > Policy status) page.
After July 20, 2022, all apps will be required to have completed the Data safety form accurately to disclose their data collection and sharing practices (including apps that do not collect any user data).
If you still need further information, please create a support ticket from the CleverTap dashboard. We would be happy to help you with any other queries.
