Prepare for Google Play's data disclosure requirements

Product News
In May 2021, Google Play announced the new Data safety section, which outlines the data collection, sharing, and security practices that Android developers must disclose in Google Play.
This page will help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure in regards to your usage of the Flurry Analytics SDK. You will find information on whether and how our SDK handles end-user data, including any applicable settings or configurations you can control as the app developer.
We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the app developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data collection, sharing, and security practices.
How to use the information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by only the latest version (version 13.3.0)of the Flurry Analytics SDK.
If you are using a prior version of the Flurry Analytics SDK, please consider updating to the latest version to ensure your app's disclosures are accurate.
To complete your data disclosure, reference Android's guide about data types to help you determine which data types and purposes best describe the collected data. In your data disclosure, make sure to also account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected data.
Overview of data encryption, data sharing, and data deletion for Flurry Android SDK
Data collected and shared automatically
The Flurry Analytics SDK collects and shares the following data types automatically for analytics, advertising, and fraud prevention purposes.
All of the user data collected by Flurry Analytics SDK is encrypted in transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
Data collected and shared depending on your usage
If you are using any optional product features that involve additional data, such as custom events, Standard Events, Performance Metrics, Crash Analytics, etc., be sure to check if those features require additional data disclosures.
