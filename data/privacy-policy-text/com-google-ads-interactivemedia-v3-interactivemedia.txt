Google Play's data disclosure requirements
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In May 2021, Google Play announced the new Data safety
section,
which is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data collection, sharing,
and security practices.
This page can help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure in
regards to your usage of the Interactive Media Ads SDK. On this page, you
can find information on whether and how our SDK handles end-user data, including any
applicable settings or configurations you can control as the app developer.
We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the app
developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google
Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data collection,
sharing, and security practices.
How to use the information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by only the latest version (version
3.30.1) of the Interactive Media Ads SDK.
If you are using a prior version of the Interactive Media Ads SDK, consider
updating to the latest version to ensure your app's disclosures are accurate.
The Interactive Media Ads SDK will continue to be updated over time. This
article will reflect these changes, so make sure to check back and update your
disclosures as necessary.
To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's guide about data
types to help you
determine which data
types
and
purposes
best describe the collected data. In your data disclosure, make sure to also
account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected data.
If you are also utilizing
Ad Manager Privacy & messaging
to collect and manage consent for
GDPR, please refer to the
User Messaging Platform SDK documentation on Google Play data disclosures.
Data collected and shared automatically
The Interactive Media Ads SDK collects and shares the following data types
automatically for
advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes.
All of the user data collected by Interactive Media Ads SDK is encrypted in
transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
Data handling
Android ad ID collection is optional. The ad ID can be reset or deleted by users
using ad ID controls in the Android settings menu. As the app developer, you can
prevent the collection of ad IDs by updating the app's manifest
file.
Certain other features in the Interactive Media Ads SDK, such as the
Limited Ads
feature, may also disable transmission of the ad ID and other data.
Data collected and shared depending on your usage
If you are using any optional product features that involve additional data
(such as advance reporting) or participating in any tests of new product
features that involve additional data, be sure to check if those features or
tests require additional data disclosures.
