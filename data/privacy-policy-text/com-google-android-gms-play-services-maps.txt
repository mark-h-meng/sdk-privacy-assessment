Prepare for Google Play's data disclosure requirements
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In May 2021, Google Play
announced the new Data safety section,
which is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data collection, sharing,
and security practices.
This page can help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure in
regards to your usage of the Maps SDK for Android. On this page, you can find
information on how the Maps SDK for Android handles end-user data, including any
applicable configurations or invocations you can control as the app
developer.
We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the
app developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google
Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data collection,
sharing, and security practices.
How to use the information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by only the latest version of
the Maps SDK for Android.
To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's
guide about data types
to help you determine which data type best describes the collected data. In
your data disclosure, make sure to also account for how your specific app
shares and uses the collected data.
Important: To help you ensure that your app's disclosures are
accurate, we recommend the following:
Always use the latest SDK version in your app. This page lists the
data collected by only the latest version of the Maps SDK for Android.
Review this page whenever you update your app's SDK versions. Check
that your data disclosures are accurate and up-to-date.
Data collected automatically
