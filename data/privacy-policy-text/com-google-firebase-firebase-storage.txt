Prepare for Google Play's data disclosure requirements
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In May 2021, Google Play
announced the new Data safety section,
which is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data collection, sharing,
and security practices.
This page can help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure in
regards to your usage of Firebase Android SDKs. On this page, you can find
information on whether and how our SDKs handle end-user data, including examples
of applicable configurations or invocations you can control as the app
developer.
We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the app
developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to
Google Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data
collection, sharing, and security practices.
How to use the information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by only the latest versionof
each Firebase Android SDK.
Each SDK has its own section later on this page where we provide information
about data collected automatically versus data collected depending on
your usage. Automatic collection means that the SDK collects specific data
without you invoking any specific method or class in your app. However, in many
cases, the data collected by the SDK depends on your app's specific usage of the
product, meaning your app's configuration and how you invoke the SDK.
To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's
guide about data types
to help you determine which data type best describes the collected data.
In your data disclosure, make sure to also account for how your specific app
shares and uses the collected data.
Important: To help you ensure that your app's
disclosures are accurate, we recommend the following:
Always use the latest SDK versions in your app. This page lists the data
collected by only the latest version of each SDK.
Review this page whenever you update your app's SDK versions. Check that
your data disclosures are accurate and up-to-date.
Overview of data encryption, data sharing, and data deletion for Firebase Android SDKs
Firebase user agent
The Firebase user agent is not a Firebase Android SDK, but rather a bundle
of information that's collected by several Firebase Android SDKs and includes
the following:
Device metadata: OS version, name, model, brand, and form factor
App that was used to install your app (for example, the Play Store) (see
documentation)
Which Firebase SDKs are used in your app, including their versions
The Firebase user agent is used internally by Google to determine platform and
version adoption in order to provide, maintain, and improve Firebase services.
It is never linked to a user or device identifier.
If a Firebase Android SDK collects the Firebase user agent, it will be listed in
the SDK's section below.
A/B Testing
com.google.firebase:firebase-abt
Data collected automatically

Since the A/B Testing SDK is only used directly by
Firebase Remote Config and
Firebase In-App Messaging, refer to those specific sections
on this page to learn more about any data collection and the purpose of
collection.
