Home > Reference Information > SDK Data Privacy and SafetySDK Data Privacy and Safety Various data is transmitted from the SDK to Kochava. This document describes SDK behavior and which datapoints are transmitted. It is intended to be used as the basis for:Google’s Data Safety QuestionnaireApple’s Data Collection QuestionnaireYour Privacy PolicyYour audit of the SDK Developing Document: This is a dynamic document that will be updated as Kochava adjusts to changes and updates.FAQ Expand All | Collapse All When is data transmitted?Data is transmitted only during app runtime milestones such as the first app launch, user session envelopes, and when performing host requested activities such as measuring an event. Data is not transmitted otherwise and can only be transmitted while the app is running. When not in use, the SDK remains idle, awaiting instruction from the host, and does not continuously transmit data to Kochava. Is data encrypted?Data is always encrypted during transmission via HTTPS. Can data transmission be disabled?Datapoint transmission may be disabled on an app-wide basis, rather than per-user basis. Many attribution-related datapoint transmissions may be disabled through your Edit App page in the dashboard, while others may be disabled upon request through your client success manager. Can data be deleted upon request?User data may be deleted from Kochava, so long as the request comes directly from the user. Is the IP address transmitted?The IP address of the device is an integral part of any network communication and is not explicitly set or controlled by the SDK; thus it is always transmitted when the device communicates with Kochava or any other entity. The IP address is used to derive a general location for purposes of analytics and reporting, but may also play a role in attribution depending on your attribution settings. What data is transmitted?Datapoints transmitted by the SDK are listed below. Keep in mind that some datapoints vary by SDK or platform, and datapoints are only transmitted if readily available for the given platform, and only if any required modules are present. Android Specific DatapointsThese transmitted datapoints are specific to the Android SDK and are primarily used for attribution and install deduplication. Additionally, many of these datapoints are transmitted only if required modules are present. iOS Specific DatapointsThese transmitted datapoints are specific to the iOS/tvOS SDK and are primarily used for attribution and install deduplication. Other IdentifiersThese transmitted datapoints are common across most SDK platforms and are primarily used for attribution and install deduplication. App State DatapointsThese transmitted datapoints are common across most SDK platforms and describe the state of the app. They are used primarily for your analytics and reporting and do not play a role in attribution. Device State DatapointsThese transmitted datapoints are common across most SDK platforms and describe the state of the device. They are used for your analytics,reporting and fraud detection; they do not play a role in attribution. Kochava Owned Backup DomainsThe following is a list of the Kochava owned backup domains that the SDK is capable of calling:kochava.comakisinn.meakisinn.infoakisinn.sitedewrain.lifedewrain.sitedewrain.worldvaicore.sitevaicore.xyzvaicore.storevlancaa.funvlancaa.site   Last Modified: Nov 3, 2022 at 10:29 amIn This Guide:IntroductionFAQAndroid Specific DatapointsiOS Specific DatapointsOther IdentifiersApp State DatapointsDevice State DatapointsKochava Owned Backup DomainsReturn To TopRelated Pages:Reference InformationSDK IntegrationIn This Guide:IntroductionFAQAndroid Specific DatapointsiOS Specific DatapointsOther IdentifiersApp State DatapointsDevice State DatapointsKochava Owned Backup DomainsReturn To TopKochava.com© 2008-2023 Kochava, Inc All rights reserved.
