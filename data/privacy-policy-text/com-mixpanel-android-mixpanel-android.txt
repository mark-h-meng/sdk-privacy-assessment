We collect information, including personal data, when you use our Services. We collect this information when you fill out forms or engage with us directly. We also collect this information via cookies, pixel tags, and certain software designed to interact with your computer or mobile device.

If you manage your account information, you may enter and share information like postal address, phone number, fax number, company name, and credit card payment information.
If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may store and use that information for internal analytics purposes.
When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline. And you may use application or device controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for specific products or features, those products or features may not be available or may not function correctly.
Information collected via technology
We automatically collect certain information via technology when you use the Services:
IP Address, Location, Website Activity, and Browser Information. When you visit our Site or use our Applications, some information is automatically collected. We collect information about the type and language of the operating system (âOSâ) running on your device, your internet protocol address (âIP Addressâ), the browser type you used during your visit, and the website you visited just before ours. We also collect information about which web-elements or objects you interact with, metadata about your activity on the Site, changes in your user state, and the duration of your visit.
Mobile Application Services.

This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you and improve our Services and analytics platform. Also, in the event our Applications crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model and OS version, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Applications. We send you a push notification from time-to-time to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about the device you are using, such as the OS and user identification information. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Applications on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the Application, the events that occur within the Application, aggregated usage, performance data, and what app store you used to download the Application.
Cookies. Mixpanel collects information about your use of our Services via cookies.
Information obtained from third-party sources
When we collect information in connection with our business relationship with you, we may also purchase data about you from third parties.
We protect information obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this Privacy Statement, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the third party providing the data. These third-party sources include, for example:
Applications and services, such as social networks that make usersâ information available to others;
Service providers that help us determine your deviceâs location based on its IP Address to customize certain products to your physical location;
Partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities; and
Publicly available sources, such as open government databases or other information in the public domain.
Information created or generated
We infer new information from the information we collect, including using automated means to make inferences about your likely preferences or other personal information. For example, we may infer your city, state, and country location based on your IP Address.

If you prefer, you can choose to set your browser to remove cookies or to reject cookies. Where appropriate, you may also be provided with further options to control the use of cookies when visiting the Site or using the Applications.
If you want to delete, remove or refuse cookies, this could affect certain features or functionality of our Site and could remove cookies used to opt-out of tracking for the Services.
Mixpanel uses cookies and similar technologies for:
Site Authentication, Identity and Access Management, Security, and to Conduct Its Business. When you sign into the Site using your username and password, we store an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the Site without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-in information, so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the Site.
Marketing. Mixpanel uses cookies and related technologies to measure your interest in Mixpanelâs products and services so it can market those products and services to you.
Interest-based advertising. Our third-party advertising partners may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interaction (including the data described in the âInformation collected via technologyâ section above) with the Services, our communications and other online services and with different browsers and devices, and use that information to serve online ads that they think will interest you. This is called interest-based advertising. We may also share information with these partners to facilitate interest-based advertising to those or similar users on other online platforms.
Performance. Mixpanel uses cookies for load balancing to help ensure that our websites remain up and running.
Social Media. Portions of our Services include social media cookies or widgets, including those that enable users who are logged in to the social media service to share content via that service.
Storing Information for Purchases on the Site. When you seek to purchase one of our Services, we may store the data in a cookie to remember the products and information you have added for purchase.
Site Experience. When you use or view certain content on the Services, Mixpanel will store a cookie to ensure that you do not see the same content again or to save your interest preferences.
Opt-Out Cookie. When you opt-out of interest-based advertising on the Site by using third party services such as the Network Advertising Initiative (or if located in the European Union, the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, Mixpanel will store a cookie that will block other cookies from being stored.

IRB, Insights, or MP: We use these cookies for Site analytics and operational purposes.
SessionID: Helps to authenticate you when you sign into your account.
Certain third parties may also set cookies on your computer or device when you visit our Sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired a third party to provide services on our behalf, such as payment processing for credit card billing. In other cases, it is because our web pages may contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content, or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third-partiesâ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties set and read their cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services. To control cookies from those third parties, visit their sites. If you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising, click here (or if located in the European Union, click here).

If any automated processing of personal data is done with your consent or under a contract with you, you have a right to transfer or receive a copy of the personal data in a usable and portable format;
You can object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of personal data under certain circumstances; and

We may rely on different lawful bases for collecting and processing personal data about you, for example, with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the Services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests.
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
In light of the Schrems II decision, Mixpanel no longer relies on the Privacy Shield Framework for data transfers. Where personal data originating in Europe is (i) directly transferred to Mixpanel by its customers, (ii) transferred by Mixpanel on an intragroup basis between Mixpanel group entities, or (iii) transferred by Mixpanel to external (sub-)processors, Mixpanel enters into Standard Contractual Clauses (âSCCsâ) with such parties. Additionally, Mixpanel has in place technical and organizational safeguards to comply with its legal obligations to protect personal data.
In the future, Mixpanel may rely on alternative transfer tools, but only to the extent such transfer tools are recognized as providing appropriate safeguards necessary to meet the requirements of applicable data protections laws.
Nonetheless, Mixpanel continues to participate in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework for its collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Mixpanel is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union member countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, respectively, to the Frameworksâ applicable principles (âPrinciplesâ). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, or to check our status, visit the U.S. Department of Commerceâs Privacy Shield website at https://www.privacyshield.gov/Program-Overview.
Mixpanel is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. If third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield Framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. Mixpanel complies with the Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to each Privacy Shield Framework, Mixpanel is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Mixpanel may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the Principles, Mixpanel commits to resolve any complaints about your privacy and our collection, use, or disclosure of your personal data. If you have any inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Statement or our compliance with Privacy Shield, you should first contact Mixpanel at the contact information set forth below.
You may have the right to access or submit requests to review, correct, update, or delete your personal data. You can ask to review or correct personal data that we maintain about you by sending a written request to compliance@mixpanel.com. We may limit or deny access to personal data where providing such access is unreasonably burdensome, expensive under the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Privacy Shield Principles.
Individuals who submit an inquiry or complaint to Mixpanel but do not receive an acknowledgment from us or think the complaint or concern has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. You must include the following information: the name of the company, the alleged privacy violation, your contact information, and whether you would like the particulars of your complaint shared with the company. Under certain conditions, more fully described here, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. In addition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is the statutory body that has jurisdiction to hear any claims against Mixpanel regarding possible unfair or deceptive practices and violations of laws or regulations governing privacy.
Location of Personal Data
The personal data we collect may be stored and processed in your country or region, or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Currently, we primarily use data centers in the United States. The storage location is chosen to operate efficiently and improve performance. We take steps designed to ensure that the personal data we collect under this Privacy Statement is processed in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable law wherever the data is located.
Location of Processing European Personal Data. We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. When we do so, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections. To learn more about the European Commissionâs decisions on the adequacy of personal data protection, please visit https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en.
Retention of Personal Data
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. These needs can vary for different information types in the context of different Services. Accordingly, our actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the information, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations.
Children
Our Services are not intended for use by anyone under 13 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian of a child from whom you believe we have collected Personal Information in a manner prohibited by law, please contact us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information through our Services from a child without the consent of the childâs parent or guardian as required by law, we will comply with applicable legal requirements to delete the information.
Changes to this Privacy Statement
Mixpanel may change this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes in our offerings, how we collect, use, or disclose personal data, or applicable law. If we make any changes to this Privacy Statement, we will change the âLast Updatedâ date above.
