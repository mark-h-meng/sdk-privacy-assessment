Safety RequirementsSuggest EditsStarting July 20, 2022, Google will require a privacy disclosure for all new apps and app updates. You will need to complete the Data safety section in the App Privacy tab in the Google Play Console. Instructions from Google can be found here. As OneSignal is a third-party to your app, you’ll need to ensure you are properly disclosing the ways you are handling user data with OneSignal.
By default, OneSignal only collects Purchases (in-app) and App interactions (clicks and session duration) for Android apps. Users who set up and collect emails, phone numbers, or additional data through Data Tags or Outcomes will need to disclose these additional data types.
Please review the following data types when filling out your Data safety details. For details on handling user data, see Handling Personal Data.
