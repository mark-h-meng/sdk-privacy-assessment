This Privacy Statement was updated on September 1, 2021.
Privacy Statement
A. General Information
When does this Privacy Statement apply?
This Privacy Statement applies to information that can be used to identify you (“Personal Data”) and that you provide to Qualtrics or which is derived from the Personal Data as outlined below. Qualtrics’ (as defined below) usage of cookies is subject to a separate cookie statement available at www.qualtrics.com/cookie-statement.
Who is the Data Controller?
The data controller of www.qualtrics.com is Qualtrics LLC, 333 W. River Park Drive, Provo, UT 84604, United States of America (“Qualtrics”). Where a registration form is presented on this website, the data controller may vary depending on the actual offering or the purpose of the data collection but it is in any case displayed on the individual registration form’s privacy statement. Qualtrics’ data protection officer can be reached at privacy@qualtrics.com.
What Personal Data does Qualtrics collect?
In the normal course of business, Qualtrics collects Personal Data such as contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number, email address, and your employer) and payment details for customers.
Why does Qualtrics need your Personal Data?
Qualtrics requires your personal data to provide you with access to Qualtrics’ services, to comply with contractual and statutory obligations, including checks required by applicable export laws and to stay in touch with you. Although providing your Personal Data is voluntary, without your Personal Data, Qualtrics cannot provide you with access to its services.
From what types of third parties does Qualtrics obtain Personal Data?
In most cases Qualtrics collects Personal Data from you. Qualtrics might also obtain Personal Data from third parties, if the applicable national law allows Qualtrics to do so. Qualtrics will treat this Personal Data according to this Privacy Statement, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the third party that provided Qualtrics with it or the applicable national law. These third-party sources include Qualtrics or the SAP Group’s (defined below) business dealings with your employer (for details, please see “Contract Performance” subsection of Section B below) or third parties you directed to share your Personal Data with Qualtrics (e.g. in case of an event where you permit the host of the event to share your registration data with Qualtrics).
How long will Qualtrics store my Personal Data?
Qualtrics will only store your Personal Data for as long as it is required for the performance of contractual obligations, to make its services available to you, for Qualtrics to comply with its statutory obligations resulting from applicable export laws, and to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement.
Qualtrics will also retain your Personal Data for additional periods if applicable laws require it.
Who are recipients of your Personal Data and where will it be processed?
Your personal data will be passed on to the following categories of third parties for processing: companies within the SAP Group; vicarious agents (e.g., third party service providers for consulting services and other additional related services); other services providers (e.g. for the provision of the website); state agencies and bodies if required by law.
As part of a global group of companies operating internationally, Qualtrics has affiliates (the “SAP Group”) and third-party service providers outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) and will transfer your Personal Data to countries outside the EEA. If these transfers are to a country for which the EU Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, Qualtrics uses the EU standard contractual clauses to contractually require that your Personal Data receives a level of data protection consistent with the EEA. You can obtain a copy of such standard contractual clauses by sending a request to privacy@qualtrics.com. You can also obtain more information from the European Commission on the international dimension of data protection here.
What are your data protection rights?
You can request from Qualtrics access at any time to information about which Personal Data Qualtrics processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Data. Please note, however, that Qualtrics can or will delete your Personal Data only if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of Qualtrics to retain it. Kindly note further that if you request that Qualtrics deletes your Personal Data, you will not be able to continue to use any Qualtrics service that requires Qualtrics’ use of your Personal Data. If you are a Qualtrics user, you should request that your Qualtrics account is deleted by your Brand Administrator. To identify your Brand Administrator, please visit here.
If Qualtrics uses your Personal Data based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you can further request from Qualtrics a copy of the Personal Data that you have provided to Qualtrics. In this case, please follow the instructions detailed below, and specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates, the format in which you would like to receive this information, and whether the Personal Data should be sent to you or another recipient. Qualtrics will carefully consider your request and discuss with you how it can best fulfill it.
Furthermore, you can request from Qualtrics that Qualtrics restricts your Personal Data from any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the Personal Data Qualtrics has about you is incorrect, subject to the time Qualtrics requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Data; (ii) there is no legal basis for Qualtrics processing your Personal Data and you demand that Qualtrics restricts your Personal Data from further processing; (iii) Qualtrics no longer requires your Personal Data but you state that you require Qualtrics to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims; or (iv) in case you object to the processing of your Personal Data by Qualtrics based on Qualtrics’ legitimate interest (as further set out below), subject to the time Qualtrics requires to determine whether it has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing the relevant Personal Data.
For individuals within the State of California, USA, you instead have the right:
to request from Qualtrics access to your Personal Data that Qualtrics collects, uses, discloses, or sells (if applicable) about you;
to request that Qualtrics deletes Personal Data about you;
to opt-out of the sale of Personal Data, if applicable;
to non-discriminatory treatment for exercise of any of your data protection rights;
in case of request from Qualtrics for access to your Personal Data, for such information to be portable, if possible, in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit this information to another recipient without hindrance.
How can you exercise your data protection rights?
To exercise your data protection rights, please complete this Privacy Request Form and fill out the relevant details to start the identity verification process. Alternatively, you can direct your request to privacy-dsr@qualtrics.com. Please indicate the following details: your full name, your country and state of residence and the right(s) you wish to exercise. If you are located in the State of California, you can also call toll-free using the numbers provided here. You can also designate another person to submit requests to exercise your data protection rights on your behalf to Qualtrics.
How will Qualtrics verify requests to exercise data protection rights?
Qualtrics will take steps to verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty before it will process the data protection right you want to exercise. When feasible, Qualtrics will match Personal Data provided in your request to exercise your rights with information already maintained by Qualtrics. This could include matching two or more data points that are already maintained by Qualtrics.
In accordance with the verification process set forth in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), for deletion requests or for requests related to Personal Data that is considered sensitive or valuable, Qualtrics will require a more stringent verification process to minimize the harm that might be posed to you by unauthorized access or deletion of your Personal Data. If Qualtrics must request additional information from you outside of information that is already maintained by Qualtrics, Qualtrics will only use it for the purposes of verifying your identity so you can exercise your data protection rights or for security and fraud-prevention purposes.
Qualtrics will decline to process requests that are manifestly unfounded, excessive, fraudulent, or are not otherwise required by local law.
If you take the view that Qualtrics is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements in this Privacy Statement or under applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country where you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state where Qualtrics is incorporated.
B. Processing based on a statutory permission
Why does Qualtrics need to use my Personal Data and on what legal basis is Qualtrics using it?
Providing the requested services. Qualtrics requires your Personal Data to deliver services that you order under a contract with Qualtrics, to establish a contract for goods or services between you and Qualtrics, and to send you invoices for ordered services. Qualtrics processes Personal Data to fulfill contractual obligations pursuant to Article 6(1), Subparagraph 1(b) GDPR.
Ensuring compliance. Qualtrics and its products, technologies, and services are subject to the export laws, trade sanctions, and embargoes (“Export Laws”) of various countries including, without limitation, those of the European Union (“EU”), Germany and of the United States of America. Therefore, You acknowledge that, pursuant to the applicable Export Laws issued by these countries, Qualtrics is required to:
(a) take measures to prevent persons, entities, and organizations listed on government-issued sanctioned party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and services through Qualtrics’s websites or other delivery channels controlled by Qualtrics. This may include (i) automated checks of any user registration data as set out herein and other information a user provides about his or her identity against applicable sanctioned-party lists; (ii) regular repetition of such checks whenever a sanctioned-party list is updated or when a user updates his or her information; (iii) blocking of access to Qualtrics’s services and systems in case of a potential match; and (iv) contacting a user to confirm his or her identity in case of a potential match; and
(b) ensure that no individuals from embargoed countries access its services. Therefore, when an existing user logs into a website, app, or cloud service of Qualtrics from an embargoed country, the user’s registration data and IP address may be used by Qualtrics to block the user’s access and to log access attempts from embargoed countries.
Any such usage of registration data and IP addresses by Qualtrics is necessary for Qualtrics’ compliance with applicable EU Export Laws (Article 6 para. 1 (c) GDPR) and Qualtrics’ legitimate interest to comply with non-EU Export Laws (Article 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR).
