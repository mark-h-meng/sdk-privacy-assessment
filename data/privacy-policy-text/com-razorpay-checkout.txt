This information helps users make more informed choices when installing apps.
By July 20, 2022, all developers must declare how they collect and handle user data for the apps they publish on Google Play and provide details about how they protect this data through security practices like encryption. This includes data collected and handled through any third-party libraries or SDKs used in their apps.
Who is responsible for providing this data?
Merchant is responsible for making complete and accurate declarations in their app's store listing on Google Play. Google Play reviews apps across all policy requirements; however, Google cannot determine how we use and handle the data on behalf of the developers. Only merchants possess all the information required to complete the Data Safety form.

Purpose of sharing information
We do not share user's Personal Information with any third party apart from financial institutions such as banks, RBI, or other regulatory agencies (as may be required) and to provide users with services that we offer through Razorpay, conduct quality assurance testing, facilitate the creation of accounts, provide technical and customer support, or provide specific services, such as synchronisation of your contacts with other software applications, following your instructions. These third parties are not required to use the user's Personal Information other than to provide the services requested by the user.
We may share users' Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, the "AFFILIATES") that we may have now or in the future, in which case we will require them to honour our Privacy Policy. If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess your Personal Information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in the Privacy Policy. We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our terms and conditions and Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal processes, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our Users, Affiliates, or the public. Please note that we are not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena, or other similar governmental requests we receive.
We may disclose information in the aggregate to third parties relating to user behavior in connection with the actual or prospective business relationship with those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertising banners.
