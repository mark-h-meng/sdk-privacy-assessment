You are entitled to decline to share certain Personal Information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide you with some of the features and functionalities of the Service. You may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account settings page on the Service. If you wish to access or amend any other Personal Information we hold about you, you may contact us at privacy@agora.io. Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so, to the extent permitted under applicable law.

If you receive any commercial emails from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the email. You may also opt-out from receiving commercial emails from us, and any other promotional communications that we may send to you from time to time, by sending your request to us by email (to privacy@agora.io) or by writing to us at the address given at the end of this policy. We may allow you to view and modify settings relating to the nature and frequency of promotional communications that you receive from us in user account functionality on the Service. Please be aware that if you opt-out of receiving commercial email from us or otherwise modify the nature or frequency of promotional communications you receive from us, it may take up to fifteen business days for us to process your request, and you may receive promotional communications from us that you have opted-out from during that period, unless we are required by applicable law to process your request within a shorter period of time.

5. Third-Party Services
This Policy applies only to the processing of your Personal Information by Agora. The Service may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties. The policies and procedures described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to Third Party websites. Any information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Service. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Service. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.

Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that Personal Information has been collected on the Service from persons under 16 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 16 years of age has obtained an account on the Service, then you may alert us at privacy@agora.io and request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our systems.
7. Data Security
We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to appropriately protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Information in our possession. WE CANNOT, HOWEVER, ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US OR STORE ON THE SERVICE, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE ALSO CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT SUCH INFORMATION MAY NOT BE ACCESSED, DISCLOSED, ALTERED, OR DESTROYED BY BREACH OF ANY OF OUR PHYSICAL, TECHNICAL, OR MANAGERIAL SAFEGUARDS. The foregoing is subject to requirements under applicable law to ensure or warrant information security.
If, under applicable law, we learn of a security breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through the Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach, you should notify us at privacy@agora.io.
8. Data Transfers
While Agora provides its Service globally, the Service is hosted in the United States. If you choose to use the Service, then please note that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of your jurisdiction to the United States and other regions where our data centers are located for storage and processing, which may not have the same level of data protection as that of your jurisdiction. Also, we may further transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service.
If you’re from EEA or UK, when we transfer your Personal Information out of the EEA or UK, we will comply with applicable EEA/UK data protection laws and take appropriate measures to safeguard the security of your Personal Information. For example, we may transfer your Personal Information to countries which have been found to provide adequate protection by the EU Commission (e.g., Switzerland and Canada) to process and store your Personal Information, or we may use contractual protections for the transfer of your Personal Information to regions which haven’t been found to provide adequate protection by the EU Commission. You may contact us as specified below to obtain a copy of the safeguards we use to transfer your Personal Information outside of EEA or the UK.
9. Data Retention
We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identification when this information is no longer required for the purposes for which we processed it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period.
When determining the retention period, we consider various criteria which include:
The type of products and services used by or provided to youThe nature and length of our relationship with youRe-enrollment with our products or servicesThe impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about youMandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations
Additionally, if you no longer desire to use our Service, you can choose to delete your account and associated information. We provide you with this option when accessing your account dashboard, where, after authenticating yourself and satisfying certain conditions, you’ll be able to request the deletion of your Agora account and associated information, unless we are legally required to keep it.
10. Changes and Updates to This Policy
Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision. If the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Service for the first time after such material changes are made. If you have an Agora account, we may also notify you of any changes / updates to this Policy in your account dashboard.
