📘New Safety Section TimelineGoogle has informed developers that all Google Play Store submissions with the new safety section information, must be approved by April 2022. We encourage you to submit your information early so you can get review feedback and make any necessary changes before you are no longer able to make new app updates.
Overview
As part of the Google Play Store Developer submission process, developers are required to fill out Google’s updated Data Safety section in the Google Play Console. When completing the Safety Section portion of your developer application, you are required to provide information about your app’s data collection and privacy practices, including the practices of third-party partners like Branch whose SDK code you integrate into your app.
After February 2022, “No information available” will be shown by Google in the Data Safety section for apps that have not submitted information in the Google Play Console for review and for apps that have submitted information but the submission was rejected.
Without an approval in the Data Safety section, your new app submission or app update may be rejected.
Answering the Google Play Store Safety Section Questions
You must select answers from the options presented in Google Play Store. Please keep in mind:
Branch’s SDKs are fully configurable by you, both in the data we collect on your behalf and how you use that data. Accordingly, you should identify all possible data collections and uses, even if not outlined here or even if certain data will be collected and used only in limited situations.
Your answers should follow the Google Play Store Safety Section Review Guidelines and any applicable laws.
We encourage you to consult with your legal counsel if you have questions about compliance with applicable laws or how your use of Branch implicates applicable laws.
You are solely responsible for keeping your responses accurate and up to date. If your practices change, update your responses in Google Play Store.

Any user data collected or transferred through a webview which can be opened from your app, unless users are navigating the open web
